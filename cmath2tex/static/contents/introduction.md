`CMath2Tex` is the tool to simplify documentation generation for source code with a lot of math expressions. 

`CMath2Tex` can help you in the following ways:  

* Quickly generates `LaTeX` equations for huge amount of math expressions in a source code.  
* Helps with representation of math formula in `LaTeX` format if you don't familiar with syntax.
